The AI Weather App is a web application that provides detailed weather information for any city in a country. It leverages the OpenAI API for natural language processing and GraphQL for querying weather data from a weather service provider.

## Features

- Weather Information: Get detailed weather information for any city in a country.
- Natural Language Queries: Use natural language queries to retrieve weather data.
- Location Autocomplete: Auto-complete feature for city names and countries to improve search accuracy.
- Weather Forecast: Access current weather conditions and forecasts for upcoming days.
- Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Data: View temperature, humidity, and wind speed information.

## Prerequisites

To run the AI Weather App, you need to have the following:

- Node.js (version >= 12.0.0) installed on your machine.
- OpenAI API key for accessing natural language processing capabilities.
- GraphQL endpoint URL for accessing weather data.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
